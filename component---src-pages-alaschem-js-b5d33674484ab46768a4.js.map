N. Mandal\n          University is the reflection of its past, representation of its\n          present and a link to its future.\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          Educational institutions are changing the way they see and interact\n          with their alumni community. Earlier, alumni and their alma-mater were\n          treated as separate entities wherein one’s existence was independent\n          of the other. Local alumni chapters were formed as a means to interact\n          with other fellow alumni. However, these associations seldom had any\n          interaction with the institution they post graduated or Ph.D holder\n          from this University Department of Chemistry With the advent of Social\n          Media, alumni relationship has taken a different flavour altogether.\n          Universities have started to harness the power of alumni through\n          various networking platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter etc. by\n          creating their alumni groups and profiles on them.\n        </blockquote>\n        Here are 4 ways in which alumni association are creating a powerful\n        positive impact:\n        <blockquote>\n          <strong>1. Support system</strong>\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          An engaged alumni network allows the University to benefit from the\n          skills and experience of our graduates, by offering their support to\n          our students, to the institution and to each other. If we keep them\n          well informed and engaged, alumni are our most loyal supporters and\n          our best ambassadors, offering invaluable marketing and promotion\n          across their personal and professional networks.\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          <strong>2. Offering expertise</strong>\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          Talented alumni will likely have a wealth of experience and skills to\n          share with current students via talks and meets. In certain cases,\n          this could go even further with alumni offering to practically support\n          students in work placements and help them launch their careers.\n          Suryadatta’s alumni create an engaged alumni network which is\n          beneficial because engaged graduates are much more likely to want to\n          “give back” to the University.\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          <strong>3. Assistance in Employability</strong>\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          Alumni network has a real life benefit for current students. Alumni\n          also donate their valuable time to offer career support to current\n          students. This enhances the students’ experience and give them that\n          competitive edge in today’s tough job market. The alumni network of a\n          college is one of the biggest sources of placement opportunities to\n          the students. Alumni can help students get placed at their respective\n          organizations.\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          <strong>4. Mentorship and Scholarships</strong>\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          Alumni can play an active role in voluntary programs like mentoring\n          students in their areas of expertise. They also play a significant\n          role in contributing scholarships to deserving students. Alumni get in\n          touch with students and share their expertise and best practices in a\n          given field.\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          Leveraging the alumni community can be a win-win for both the\n          institution and the alumni. Many of them are willing to ‘Give-Back’ to\n          their alma-mater as a sign of their gratitude and affinity towards the\n          institution.\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          <strong>Reconnect.</strong> Find and reminisce with fellow graduates;\n          see what everyone’s been up to!\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          <strong>Give back.</strong> Make meaningful connections, recruit\n          future Wildcats, speak to students and advise fellow alumni.\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          <strong>Expand.</strong> Leverage your professional network to get\n          introduced to people you should know\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n          This alumni connect by allows you to reconnect with classmates and\n          expand your professional network through this alumni-only environment\n        </blockquote>\n      </h5>\n\n      <br />\n\n      <h4>\n        <strong>Downloads</strong>\n      </h4>\n      <h6>\n        {\" \"}\n        <Container fluid>\n          <Row>\n            <Button\n              variant=\"outline-dark\"\n              size=\"lg\"\n              block\n              href=\"../documents/alaschem/Alumni.Association.of.Chemistry.Receipt.Voucher.pdf\"\n            >\n              Alumni Association of Chemistry Receipt Voucher{\" \"}\n              <Badge bg=\"secondary\">PDF</Badge>\n            </Button>\n          </Row>\n        </Container>\n      </h6>\n      <hr></hr>\n      <br></br>\n    </Layout>\n  </React.Fragment>\n)\nexport default ALASCHEM\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
