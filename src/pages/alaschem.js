<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Educational institutions are changing the way they see and interact with their alumni community. Earlier, alumni and their alma-mater were treated as separate entities wherein one’s existence was independent of the other. Local alumni chapters were formed as a means to interact with other fellow alumni. However, these associations seldom had any interaction with the institution they post graduated or Ph.D holder from this University Department of Chemistry With the advent of Social Media, alumni relationship has taken a different flavour altogether. Universities have started to harness the power of alumni through various networking platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter etc. by creating their alumni groups and profiles on them.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">Talented alumni will likely have a wealth of experience and skills to share with current students via talks and meets. In certain cases, this could go even further with alumni offering to practically support students in work placements and help them launch their careers.  Suryadatta’s  alumni create an engaged alumni network which is beneficial because engaged graduates are much more likely to want to “give back” to the University.</p>
